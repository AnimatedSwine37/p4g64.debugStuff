# 0.0.4
Added very WiP support for the FBN Editor menu. This is mainly useful for freecam and removing NPCs currently. Trying to move existing or new ones causes a crash :(

The keybinds for the ENV and FBN menus can be changed in the mod's configuration. They default to F4 and F5 respectively.

# 0.0.3
- Fixed the text in the debug menu being really big.

Previously I did not know how to change text size so I expanded the size of all options to fit big text, now I've put them back to what they originally were which is much smaller. I believe a different font would've been used in the real debug menu but this is much closer than before.

# 0.0.2
- Added update information :naosmiley:

# 0.0.1
- The very WiP first version of the mod, just includes Environment Editor activated by pressing F4.
