# P4G Debug Stuff
A very WiP mod that aims to restore the debug menu to P4G 64-bit along with other debug related functionality.

## Features
The only feature currently is the ability to open the Environment Editor by pressing `F4`, this menu lets you edit stuff such as lighting and fog.

I will hopefully add more to this and make it much less janky eventually, I've really just released this because it has been used to make [P4 Fog Restoration](https://github.com/BrawlerAce/p4g64.fogrestoration) :)
